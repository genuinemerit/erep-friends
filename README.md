- Gather eRep profile on user, user's friends list, or any valid eRep citizen profile ID
  - With option to launch a scheduled pull/refresh
- Store info in a persistent database
- Update deltas from time to time, save time-series data
- Perform various types of selects, filters, sorts
- Do various types of data analysis
  - Generate interesting graphs and visuals
- See if in-game messages can be managed without having to get into auto-defeating captchas
